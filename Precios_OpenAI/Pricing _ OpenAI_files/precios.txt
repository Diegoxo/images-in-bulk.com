Prompts are billed similarly to other GPT models. Image outputs cost approximately $0.01 (low), $0.04 (medium), and $0.17 (high) for square images.
*available via the Responses API
*text output tokens include model reasoning tokens
For detailed token usage by image quality and size, see the docs.
Responses API
Our newest API combining the simplicity of Chat Completions with the built-in tool use of Assistants.

Price
Responses API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model’s input and output rates.
Chat Completions API
Build text-based conversational experiences.

Price
Chat Completions API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Assistants API
Build assistant-like experiences with our tools.

Price
Assistants API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Built-in tools
Extend model capabilities with built-in tools in the API Platform.

Tool
Cost
Code Interpreter
$0.03 / session
File Search Storage
$0.10 / GB of vector storage per day (first GB free)
File Search Tool Call
(Responses API only)
$2.50 / 1k tool calls
Web Search Tool Call
There are two components that contribute to the cost of using the web search tool: (1) Tool calls and (2) Search content tokens.
Tool calls are billed per 1,000 calls, according to the tool version and model type.
Search content tokens are tokens retrieved from the search index and fed to the model alongside your prompt to generate an answer. These are billed at the model’s input token rate, unless otherwise specified.
Tool Version	Cost
Web search (all models)	$10.00 / 1K calls + search content tokens billed at model rates1
Web search preview (reasoning models)	$10.00 / 1K calls + search content tokens billed at model rates
Web search preview (non-reasoning models)	$25.00 / 1K calls + search content tokens are free
1For gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4.1-mini with the web search non-preview tool, search content tokens are charged as a fixed block of 8,000 input tokens per call.
The billing dashboard will report gpt-4.1 and gpt-4.1-mini search line items as ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o’ and ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o-mini’
GB refers to binary gigabytes of storage (also known as gibibyte), where 1GB is 2^30 bytes.

FAQ

Which model should I use?
We recommend that developers use our large and mini GPT models for everyday tasks. Our large GPT models generally perform better on a wide range of tasks, while our mini GPT models are fast and inexpensive for simpler tasks.

Our large and mini reasoning models are ideal for complex, multi-step tasks and STEM use cases that require deep thinking about tough problems. You can choose the mini reasoning model if you're looking for a faster, more inexpensive option.

We recommend experimenting with all of these models in the Playground⁠⁠(opens in a new window) to explore which models provide the best price performance trade-off for your usage.
